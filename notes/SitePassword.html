    <p>
       “Dealing with passwords is awful” is a statement few would disagree with. 
        Password managers make the situation less awful, improving both security 
        and usability by making it easier for you to have a different, 
        strong password for every site.  Most password managers store your passwords 
        in the cloud.  SitePassword is different; it calculates your password 
        when you need it.
    </p>
    <p>
        SitePassword is a browser add-on that runs in Firefox and most Chromeum
        browsers. It is a password calculator designed for usability and
        security that supports the features you want in a password manager.
        It remembers your settings and synchronzes them across your devices;
        it finds and autofills login forms; and it provides a web page you can 
        use to get your passwords from any device.  It also allows you to provide 
        your own passwords making it a hybrid of the 
        two types. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When you first encounter a page with a login form at a given domain, 
        the password field contains a placeholder <em>Click SitePassword</em>.

        Clicking the SitePassword icon opens the popup. As you fill in the form 
        the site password field updates on every keystroke, making it clear how 
        uncorrelated the generated site passwords are.

    </p>
    <p>
        As you mouse over to the login form, the placeholder changes to Click here for password. 
    </p>

        Click and your password gets filled in. 
    </p>

    <p>
        When you return to that login page on any machine that synchronizes your bookmarks 
        and has the extension installed, your userid is automatically filled in.  You only 
        need to click on the password field. The result is that using SitePassword is even 
        easier than typing the same, weak password for every site.
    </p>
    <p>
        SitePassword also provides a web page that you can use to get your 
        passwords when the extension is not available, such as on your mobile devices. You don’t 
        even have to remember your settings if you synchronize bookmarks to the device. Just 
        navigate to the corresponding bookmark.  You’ll be taken to sitepassword.info with your 
        settings filled in.
