                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <div id="overviewp">
                        <p>
                            It's too hard for you to remember a strong password for every site
                            you use. Password managers take care of this problem for you. Most
                            of them store your passwords in encrypted form, either on your
                            machine or in the cloud.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SitePassword is different. It calculates your password for the
                            site from a single master password and your nickname and user name
                            for the site. That means you can get your password if you remember
                            those three things. Just click the SitePassword icon, and fill in
                            the form.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can also get your passwords without the extension. Go to
                            <a href="https://sitepassword.info">SitePassword.info</a> and fill
                            in the form.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some sites make you change your password periodically.
                            SitePassword makes that easy. Just change your nickname for the
                            site. For example, if your current nickname is
                            <em>MyBank2021</em>, and they make you change your password once a
                            year, you could change the nickname to <em>MyBank2022</em>. Your
                            new site password will be completely different from the old one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SitePassword includes an antiphishing feature. If you try to use
                            the same nickname for another domain name, you will get a big,
                            scary warning. It's telling you that you may be at a site spoofing
                            the one you think you are at. Unfortunately, you will also see
                            this warning when you are not being tricked. Many websites have
                            several different login pages with different domain names. So,
                            when you see the warning, check the URL of the page to make sure
                            it's a login page for the site you think it is.
                        </p>

                <section id="master">
                    <h3>Your Master Password</h3>
                    <div id="masterp">
                        <p>
                            You should choose a strong master password, one with upper and
                            lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. The stronger
                            the better. The reason is simple. A bad guy who knows one site
                            password and can guess your nickname and user name for that site
                            can start guessing master passwords. You want to make that job has
                            hard as you can.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SitePassword cannot retrieve your master password. You should make
                            sure it's something you won't easily forget. You might even want
                            to write it down and keep the copy in a secure place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since SitePassword doesn't store your passwords, there's no way
                            you can use your existing passwords with it. You will have to use
                            the web site's <em>Change Password</em> or
                            <em>Forgot Password</em>
                            feature on sites where you already have accounts.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Using the Chrome Extension</h3>
                    <div id="extensionp">
                        <p>
                            After you install the Chrome extension and visit a page with a
                            login form, you'll see that the password field tells you to
                            <em>Click SitePassword</em>. When you click on the SitePassword
                            icon, you'll see a form with the domain name field filled in.
                            Enter your master password, an easy to remember nickname for the
                            site and your user name for the site. You will see your site
                            password being calculated as you type. Mouse over to the site's
                            password field, which now should tell you to
                            <em>Click here for password</em>. Click, and your password gets
                            filled in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you reload the page, you'll see your user name filled in and
                            instructions to <em>Click here for password</em>. Click, and your 
                            password gets filled in.  If it says,
                            <em>Click SitePassword</em>, you will have to enter your master
                            password again. That's because SitePassword never stores your
                            master password; it only remembers it for the duration of your
                            browser session. If your settings aren't there when you think they
                            should be, reloading the page with the login form will solve the
                            problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes you won't see either <em>Click here for password</em> or
                            <em>Click SitePassword</em>.  You can see the instructions by holding 
                            your mouse over the password field for a second or two.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you go to the same web page on a different machine that you
                            synchronize bookmarks with, you'll see your nickname and user name
                            for the site filled in for you. That's because the extension
                            stores your settings in a bookmark folder called
                            <em>SitePasswordData</em>. The extension uses the bookmarks with
                            numeric titles, <em>e.g., </em> "0", "1"<em>, etc</em>. The
                            bookmarks with domain names for titles are for use on
                            <a href="https://sitepassword.info">SitePassword.info</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some pages have more than one password field, such as those for
                            creating an account or changing your password. In those cases, you
                            may see instructions to <em>Paste your password here</em>.
                            Clicking on the SitePassword icon and then clipboard icon in the
                            site password field will put your site password on the clipboard.
                            After you're done pasting it, you should copy something else to
                            the clipboard so your password isn't on the clipboard any longer
                            than necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There may be a time when you want to forget the settings for a 
                            particular domain name.  Maybe you cancelled your account at the 
                            site and want to use the site name for another one.  Or, maybe 
                            you inadverently accepted a phishing site.  You can forget the 
                            settings by clicking on SitePassword and clearing the site 
                            name field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SitePassword is able to find the password field on all of the more
                            than 100 sites it's been tested on. If the instructions don't show
                            up in the site's password field, and holding the mouse over it for
                            a few seconds doesn't show a popup with the instructions, try
                            clicking a blank spot on the page. If that doesn't work you can
                            always click the SitePassword icon and manually copy your site
                            password to the clipboard.
                        </p>

                            tested on hundreds of web sites to make sure it can always compute a

                            You might feel uncomfortable having your master password available
                            for your entire browser session, say when you walk away from your
                            machine for a few minutes. The
                            <em>Clear master password on use</em>
                            checkbox avoids this risk. Of course, you'll have to enter your
                            master password every time you need a site password. There is also
                            a risk to this choice; you are more likely to have a keylogger
                            that can capture your master password running the longer your
                            browser session lasts.

                        <p>
                            There is a <em>Download Site Data</em> button at the bottom of the
                            page. Clicking it lets you save your settings in a file you can
                            reference if you're at a machine that doesn't have your
                            SitePassword settings. This data doesn't contain anything that
                            would seriously compromise your security if it got exposed, but
                            you shouldn't publish it widely.

                            Many households have one machine shared by everybody. It's likely
                            that everyone uses the same user name and password for certain
                            sites, such as streaming services. It's also likely that those
                            people use their individual usernames and passwords for other
                            sites, such as social media.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SitePassword accomodates those uses with a feature provided by
                            Google called <em>profiles</em>. Each profile gets its own
                            bookmarks and local storage. Simply create one profile for the
                            shared account and one for each individual.

                            If you are worried that SitePassword might go away, you can

                            project. (For historical reasons, these are separate projects with
                            a lot of duplicated code.)
