Open Source

keepass: Mostly Windows, uses clipboard, Mac version is an app
not integrated with browser, too hard to figure out how to use

padloc: uses clipboard

passbolt: requires a server

bitwarden: chrome extension must be open, works on fewer pages
than SitePassword, works on myhealth

lesspass: calculates passwords, doesn't remember userids,
uses clipboard

psono: uses clipboard, no autofill from extension, doesn't
auto-recognize site

ratticDB: relies on encrypted filesystem, user must setup DB

passwordsafe: Windows only, uses clipboard

encryptr: from SpiderOak, cloud-based e-wallet, build from source

keeper: autofills without user action, works with lots of
sites I have trouble with, not open source

1password: autofill doesn't get username on semrush, doesn't get
userid on myhealth
