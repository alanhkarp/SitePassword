SitePassword
============

SitePassword is a Chrome extension that calculates your passwords from a master password, your userid at the site, and your nickname for the site.  One click on the password field fills in the login form for you.  That makes your life simpler.  You don't even need to remember your userid, just one password for all your sites.  SitePassword is also a web page, https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com, that allows you to get your passwords when you're not on a machine that has the extension installed.

SitePassword also makes you safer.  It produces a different, very strong password for each site.  It also remembers which domain name is associated with your site information and warns you if you might be at a phishing site.

## Overview 
            
It's too hard for you to remember a strong password for every
site you use.  Password managers take care of this problem for 
you.  Most of them store your passwords in encrypted form, either 
on your machine or in the cloud.  You will have to enter your
password manager's password to log into a site, something you 
may not want to do on a machine you don't trust with all your 
passwords.
            
            
SitePassword is different.  It calculates your password for the
site from a single master password and your nickname and username 
(userid) for the site.  That means you can get your password if 
you remember those three things.  Just come to 
[SitePassword](https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com) and
fill in the form.  There is also an extension for the Chrome 
browser that you can install.


SitePassword includes an antiphishing feature.  If you try to use 
the same nickname for another domain name, you will get a big, 
scary warning.  It's telling you that you may be at a site 
spoofing the one you think you are at.  Enter a domain name,
say *bankofthewest.com*, fill in the menu and click
the *Remember* button.  Next enter the domain name 
*bankofthevvest.com*.  (Notice the double v.)  This
trick was actually used by criminals trying to steal people's
credentials.  That's a good reason to paste the domain name 
from the address bar of the page rather than typing it into the 
form manuallly. Now fill in the menu with the nickname you used
before to see the scary message.

Unfortunately, you will also see this warning when you are not
being tricked.  Many websites have several different login pages 
with different domain names.  So, when you see the warning, check 
the URL of the page to make sure it's a login page for the site 
you think it is.


Since SitePassword doesn't store your passwords, there's no way
you can use your existing passwords with it.  You will have to use 
the web site's *Change Password* or *Forgot Password*
feature on sites where you already have accounts.
            
## Common Features
            
Using the [SitePassword](https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com)
web page to compute a password is similar to the way you use 
the Chrome extension.  In both cases, you fill in your master 
password, nickname and user name for the site, and your  password 
for the site is calculated for you.  The differences are 
described in later sections.


Some web sites have strict password rules, how long it must be,
if it must contain upper case or lower case letters, numbers, or
special characters, including restrictions on which special
characters are allowed.  If you run into a site that doesn't 
accept the calculated password, click the *More*
button and change the appropriate menu entries.  SitePassword 
was tested on 100s of web sites to make sure it can always 
compute a valid password.


Some sites make you change your password periodically.  SitePassword
makes that easy.  Navigate to the site's login page, and change your 
nickname for the site.  For example, if your current nickname is
*MyBank*, and they make you change your password once a year, 
you could change the nickname to *MyBank2022*.


There is a *Download Site Data* button at the bottom of 
the page.  Clicking it lets you save your settings in a file you 
can reference if you're at a machine that doesn't have your 
SitePassword settings. This data doesn't contain anything that would 
seriously compromise your security if it got exposed, but you shouldn't 
publish it widely.  
            
## Using the Chrome Extension
            
After you install the Chrome extension and visit a page with a 
password field, you'll see that it tells you to *Click SitePassword*.
When you click on the SitePassword icon, you'll see a form like the 
one at <a href="https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com">SitePassword</a> with the 
Domain Name field filled in.  Enter your master password, an easy to 
remember nickname for the site and your user name for the site.  You 
will see your site password being calculated as you type.  Mouse over 
to the site's password field, which now should tell you to *Click 
here for password*.  Click, and your password gets filled in.  


When you reload the page, you'll see your user name filled in and 
instructions to *Click here for password*.  If it says, 
*Click SitePassword*, you will have to enter your master
password again.  That's because SitePassword never stores your 
master password; it only remembers it for the duration of your 
browser session.


If you go to the same web page on a different machine which you
synchronize bookmarks with, you'll see your nickname and user name for 
the site filled in for you.  That's because the extension stores your
settings in a bookmark folder called *SitePasswordData*.
The extension uses the bookmarks with numeric titles, *e.g.,
"0", "1"*, *etc*.  The bookmarks with domain names for 
titles are for use on [SitePassword](https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com).


The *Forget* button allows you to delete the settings for a 
site you didn't mean to use.  For example, you may have created
settings for the wrong web site, which might lead to confusion a 
year in the future.


Some pages have more than one password field, such as those for 
creating an account or changing your password.  In those cases,
you may see instructions to *Paste your password here*.
SitePassword has already put your site password on the clipboard
and will remove it in a minute.


SitePassword is able to find the password field on all of the hundreds
of sites it's been tested on.  If the instructions don't show up in 
the site's password field, and holding the mouse over it for a few
seconds doesn't show a popup with the instructions, try clicking a blank 
spot on the page.  If that doesn't work you can always click the 
SitePassword icon and manually copy your site password to the clipboard. 


If you click the *More* button, you'll see and *Instructions*
button.  Clicking it will take you to [SitePassword](https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com)
where you can open the instructions.
            
## Using the SitePassword Web Page
            
The SitePassword <a href="sitepassword.alanhkarp.com">web page</a> 
can use bookmarks created by the extension to sutomate filling in 
the form.  Simply find the appropriate bookmark in the 
SitePasswordData bookmark folder, and paste it into the top field 
on the form.  You will see the domainname, site name, and user
name fields get filled in.  If you would like to skip this step 
in the future on this machine, click the *Remember*
button.  


You can paste the site's domain name into the form.  Your
site name and user name will be filled in if you had clicked the 
*Remember* button earlier for this domain name.
