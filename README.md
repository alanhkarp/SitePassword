SitePassword
============

SitePassword is a Chrome extension that calculates your passwords from a master password, your userid at the site, and your nickname for the site.  One click on the SitePassword button fills in the login form for you.  That makes your life simpler.  You don't even need to remember your userid, just one password for all your sites.  SitePassword is also a web page that allows you to get your passwords when you're not on a machine that has the extension installed.

SitePassword also makes you safer.  It produces a different, very strong password for each site.  It also remembers which domain name is associated with your site information and warns you if you might be at a phishing site.
