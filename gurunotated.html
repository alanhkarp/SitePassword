UCAN is an object with a Revoke method, which can have a return value of succuss/failure.

You typically delegate the revoke permission of the delegated UCAN, not the one it's delegated from.

Revocation as a permission goes back to the caretaker pattern of the 1970s.

I don't understand how ucan:* works.  Who keeps track of new delegations?  Would it be simpler to give the delegatee a capability to the delegator's power box?
